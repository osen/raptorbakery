# Raptor Bakery
A plugin for Blender to bake lighting

This is plugin was developed because Blender 2.80 dropped its
internal Renderer (Blender Render) which was very useful for lightmap
generation. This plugin allows us to use the Cycles renderer to achieve
similar without having to fork and maintain version 2.79.
